## Aperçu

The ZALORA brand typeface is Aperçu. It is as much a representation of the brand as is our logo. It is the vehicle that carries our message.

> Uppercase tracking should always be set to a minimum of **130**. Lowercase/sentence case tracking should always be fixed at **75**.

### About Aperçu

This is a contemporary, sans serif font with clean lines and with smooth, subtly rounded edges. It
is distinct, modern and also neutral enough to use across the collaterals which we create for the wide spectrum of brands we carry.

### Stylisation

Uppercase tracking should always be set to a minimum of **130**. Lowercase/sentence case tracking should always be fixed at **75**.

## Baskerville

Our supporting typeface is Baskerville Italic. We use only the regular weight in Italic styling.

### About Baskerville italic

This is a classic and elegant serif font that complements well with our primary typeface Aperçu, a modern sans-serif. This should be used on selectively and sparingly. Think of it as the special occa- sion scarf in your drawer that you whip out once in awhile when your outfit feels like it’s lacking that certain pizzazz.

### Stylisation

We only use Baskerville Italic for low- ercase/sentence case. Tracking should always fixed at 0.

<p style="overflow-x: hidden; font-family: Baskerville; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2;">
    <span style="font-size: 120px;">Baskerville</span>
    <span style="font-size: 60px;">Italic</span>
</p>

> We use Baskerville Italic for lowercase/sentence case only. Tracking is fixed at 0.

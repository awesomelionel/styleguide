## Master Logo

Our Master Logo is our strongest visual branding element and is used as a signa- ture mark that represents our brand.

It should always be reproduced from master digital artwork. It should never be reproduced or altered.

Our logo colours should always be in Black #000000 or White #FFFFFF. The colours cannot be modified.

### WWW.ZALORA.COM Master Logo

This is the secondary logo. It appears as a complement to the primary logo or can be used as a separate entity in footers. It can be substituted with the URLs for other ZALORA ventures, e.g WWW.ZALORA.CO.TH

### Used Together

The two logos can be used together, for e.g, on advertising. A space of 2 cap-height be- tween the two logos needs to be maintained. Both logos are centered on vertical axis.

### Clearspace

A minimum clear space of one cap-height (derived from the capital Z in ZALORA) must surround the logo as an invisible guide.

When we position our logo on commu- nications, we must ensure that the area around our logo is not hindered by dis- tracting graphics, text and imagery.

When used on top of photography or graphics, our logo must be legible.

### Logo abuse

These are some examples of logo abuse.

Any form of logo abuse will weaken our communications, confuse our customers and potentially damage us as a brand and a business.

Our logos should always be taken from our master artwork files and never altered, redrawn, recoloured, or manipulated in any way.
